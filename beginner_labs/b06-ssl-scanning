You work as a pentester for EGS. One of EGS clients approached you to pentest their network and servers, as they deployed a new website and implemented SSL encryption on it. As you began to test them, you discovered that the client has implemented a very old version of OpenSSL on one of their servers 10.10.1.7. What is the version of SSL running on the server

===================


website: 10.10.1.7 
clue: ssl encryption implemented and old openssl used
task: find the ssl version 


procedure: 
curl -kI https://10.10.1.7 

or
nmap -p443 --script http-server-header, http-headers,ssl-cert,ssl-enum-ciphers 10.10.1.7 / 
nmap -A -O -T5 10.10.1.7 

or 
use sslscan
sslscan 10.10.1.7
